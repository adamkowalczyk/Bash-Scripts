# Trying out executing commands in scripts

# looks like you don't need eval! where did I get that idea?



# try piping:
echo 'pwd piped through tr:'
pwd | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'


# try variables..
echo 'pwd dumped in a var and echoed:'

# $() notation exectutes command (also backticks, but they're deprecated)

Dir=$(pwd)

echo $Dir
